# About
This is a special repo that allows us to have an organizational README.md in [.github/profile/README.md](https://github.com/ASSETS-Conference/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) that shows up when you visit

See "[Adding a public organization profile README]([url](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme)https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme)" in the GitHub docs.
